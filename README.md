# RoBlock
A filter and chrome extension for Roblox accounts with potential inappropriate influence.

## The Idea 
The idea stems from a RubenSim video discussing the Roblox condo chain and how he was taking it into his own hands to protect children from the games. We decided to try to make a 
extension with as few lines of code as possible. That's why this extension is only configured with 150 lines of code, easy to download and contribute too. We were talking to developers and we thought that if 150 lines of code can potentially help millions why can't Robloxes huge team do 300 lines and save billions?
